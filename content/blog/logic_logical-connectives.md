Logical connectives are essential to the logic unit
<!--more-->

## Negation
Negation is a unary operater. Negation produces the opposite of the result. The symbol for representing negation for ```p``` is ```¬p```
#### Example
$$
\begin{split} 
p = \text{animals can fly} \\\\\\
\neg p = \text{animals cannot fly}
\end{split}
$$

## Conjuction
Conjunction is a binary operator. Conjuction (the 'AND' operator) produces a true if both the left side and the right side are true. The symbol for representing conjunction is ∧
#### Example
$$
\begin{split} 
p = \text{animals can fly} \\\\\\
q = (1 + 1 = 2) \\\\\\\
p \land q \text{ will be false}
\end{split}
$$


## Disjunction
Disjunction is a binary operator. Disjunction (the 'OR' operator) produces a true if either the left side or the right side is true. The symbol for representing conjunction is ∨
#### Example
$$
\begin{split} 
p = \text{animals can fly} \\\\\\
q = (1 + 1 = 2) \\\\\\\
p \lor q \text{ will be true}
\end{split}
$$

### Exclusive Disjunction
Exclusive disjunction (the 'XOR' operator) is the same as a logical disjunction except that if both values are true than it will be false
#### Example
$$
\begin{split} 
p = \text{animals cannot fly} \\\\\\
q = (1 + 1 = 2) \\\\\\\
p \oplus q \text{ will be false}
\end{split}
$$

## Implication
Implication (IF) produces a true if the right side is true when the left side is true. The symbol for representing conjunction is ⟹
#### Example
$$
\begin{split} 
p = \text{animals can fly} \\\\\\
q = (1 + 1 = 2) \\\\\\\
p \implies q \text{ will be true but} \\\\\\
q \implies p \text{ will be false}
\end{split}
$$
### Bi-Implication
Bi-implication is when both the left side implies the right side and the right side implies the left side (if and only if). The symbol for bi-implication is ⟺
#### Example
$$
\begin{split}
p \implies q \\\\\\
q \implies p \\\\\\
p \iff q \text{ will be true }
\end{split}
$$
